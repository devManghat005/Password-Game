# Password-Game

The Password Game is a challenging web-based game created using HTML and JavaScript. It starts with a simple task: create a password. However, each time a password is submitted, the game imposes increasingly bizarre and unexpected requirements, progressively making it more difficult to satisfy all criteria. The result is an entertaining, escalating puzzle that humorously illustrates the complexity of modern password rules.
